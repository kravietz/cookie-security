<dt><a href="https://webcookies.org/articles/43/http-state-tokens">HTTP State Tokens</a></dt>

<dt><a href="https://webcookies.org/articles/41/what-exactly-is-a-permanent-cookie">What exactly is a permanent cookie?</a></dt>
<dd>We often receive questions like &quot;what a permanent cookie is and whether it is considered a technical cookie&quot; so here comes a bit of clarification on what is an intersection between the technical and legal jargon. *Permanent cookie* is simply a technical name for any HTTP cookie ([RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) set …</dd>

<dd>Both `&lt;base&gt;` HTML5 tag and Content Security Policy `base-uri` directive are widely misunderstood and, at best, ignored.

<dd>A year ago Chrome announced plans to [remove HTTP Public Key Pinning](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5903385005916160) from the Chrome browser in version 69.

<dt><a href="https://webcookies.org/articles/8/what-is-mixed-content">What is mixed content?</a></dt>
<dd>Mixed content is when a TLS (`https`) website loads non-TLS (`http`) resources. The latter will significantly reduce the protection provided by TLS on the parent website as it can be easily intercepted, modified and used for active attacks against the user.
